# Figure List
* Fig. 1. Photographs of some existing SIMs. (a) A three-layer SIM; (b) A five-layer SIM.
* Fig. 2. The considered SIM-aided array system.
* Fig. 3. Top and front views of the considered SIM-based systems.
* Fig. 4. The proposed SIM-based DOA estimation protocol, where different colors refer to non-overlapping spatial frequency bins associated with different snapshots. This is achieved by adjusting the phase shifts of the input metasurface layer. The vertical and horizontal lines correspond to $\psi_x$ and $\psi_y$, respectively.
